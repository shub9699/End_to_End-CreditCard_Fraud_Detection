Piplines we will be using are:
1.Load Data 
2.Basic data understanding and visualization
3.Data preprocessing
4.Feature Engineering
5.Feature Selection
6.Imputing null values in numerical and cateorical using KNN imputer and iterative imputer
7.Dataset building
8.Model Building: RandomForest, Logistic, KNN, XGBoost, Gradient, ANN.
9.predction on random test rows.
